4xe6ed,phd_dude,"LPT: Daily use of the art of UPOD (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. Tell your S.O. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. Tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.",Social,"Under-promise, over-deliver (UPOD).  Not new advice, I know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    These are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an M.D. Ph.D. in Neuroscience/Neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, I under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  1.) Realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). People often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 2.) UPOD only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  You shouldn’t tell your SO that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.3.)  **Don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  If you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  This is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  Although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody’s fault but your own.  First of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over UPOD with them again.  Many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  Second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually OPUD (Over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  You might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  4.) When starting out, **Buffer UPOD with ""I wish"" statements**.  I have 4 kids, and with my M.D. Ph.D. training, I literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  At the beginning of each school year, I remind my kids that although I wish I could make it to every event, I will not be able to attend everything. Every time I show up, my kids are totally stoked.  I sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know I can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  Although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, I have found quite the opposite.  I have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that I say I will be at. 5.) When employing UPOD, **Focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  For instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""I really wish I could go, but I probably can't.  Could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   When a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know “I will check with the Chef to see if I can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  However, I can bring you some free extra breadsticks that I can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.”   6.)  **You can maintain an optimistic attitude while still UPOD-ing to yourself**.  I just realized that UPOD-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  I used to always tell myself that I would get more work/homework done over Christmas vacation.  Turns out, I was always disappointed at how much I actually got done.  Now, before the break, I tell myself I will be happy to get 10 or so hours’ worth of work done each vacation period. If I get more done, I am pretty proud of myself.   For instance, even though I spent about an hour putting this post together, I am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  This is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success I have, it is worth it (also, I plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   7.) **Under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  Realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  Teach them, in gentle ways, how to UPOD. 8.) **In some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are UPOD-ing**.  Example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a Friday evening).  I say “some instances” because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  For example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  For instance, you don’t need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  I apologize if this felt like a lecture, I just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before I had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    Thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, I am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of UPOD.Tl;DR:  Under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.Edit: Formatting.  Edit:  Thanks for my first Reddit Gold!!!  Edit:  The driving example was  probably a terrible one, just the first one that came to my mind.  My wife is a very patient person, this was just the first example that came to my mind (my wife usually just wants to know when I am home and if they should start dinner with me wait a bit).  She is my rock.  I have also supported her in her career goals and am supporting her through school right now as well!  I am very thankful when she UPOD to me as well.  Edit:  For those wondering, I have finished my Ph.D. and have a few years left of medical training.  Thanks for the well wishes.

51av2h,onqqq2,LPTs: Chrome extensions I wish I knew of back when I started college.,Computers,"As I am about to enter my grad school I have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier. As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. [**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. [**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. [**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. [**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. [**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. [**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally. I was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for $40 to understand what I'm looking at, so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules.**Bonus Tips That I Learned*****Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites.

5tqj0t,briskyfresh,LPT: Your hearing is not invincible. Please lower your volume when listening to music. Bring earplugs to concerts. Do not make the same mistake I made.,Health & Fitness,"Your hair cells are fragile. Protect them. I made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made. Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google ""tinnitus definition"" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. ""[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million Americans — experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"" Stay safe everyone. EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 3) **there are earplugs called ~~""Etymotic""~~(just search for ""earplugs that don't muffle sound"") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. /u/ukralibre said ""Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed."" However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just ""disappears"". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.

This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  **Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  **Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! **Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  *Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*Edit 1**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.Edit 2**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.

So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.",Social,"This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think ""how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around"".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. I'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.***********Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return.

If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618).

You may be ""grandfathered in"" on a slower, more expensive plan.",Money & Finance,"Realized this the other day, and I wish I had figured it out years ago. My family has been on the same internet + phone + cable package from Knology (now WOW) for over a decade. After fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though I don't know the cable/phone details, I do know we were only getting 20 Mbps down/2 Mbps up internet speed. That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. WOW seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but I can't speak for any other ISP.",1247,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/7rmd08/lpt_if_youve_had_the_same_internet_service_plan/,28705
7sgpyf,spudman238,"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.",School & College,"The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.**To high school juniors and seniors:** Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. **Is there any money in it?**There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.**What are my options?**There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.**TL;DR**If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT.

Most American employers/career help centers I’ve met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won’t go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. Anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. A few people have mentioned LaTeX. I use LaTeX often in my math coursework, but I’m not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. Pages (on Mac) has been sufficient for me.As far as LinkedIn go, it’s a less-detailed version of the master document I keep, as far as work experience goes, but I go way more in depth into relevant coursework and proficiencies on LinkedIn than I do on paper.

82enz9,NotKennethBone,"LPT: When resigning from a company, don't tell a single person until your management has acknowled and accepted it.",Careers & Work,"As a manager who faces employee resignations, in many ways it can open a door to conversation. It's not always about money. Maybe it's an opportunity in another department, maybe it's a change in responsibility and yes, sometimes it's a pay change.However, the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them you've just given your notice, that opportunity is gone. Management generally doesn't need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that. If half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company, everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior.Also, accepting a counter offer is NOT the end of the world as many would have you believe. It's entirely situational and sometimes you have to play the game.EDIT: Wow. Compensation is always a touchy subject. A few things to understand before you continue to assume that I am the world's worst manager.  1. Someone posted a good summary of how the annual review/raise process works.  We get a bucket of money to spread across a team as we see fit.  It's usually a small bucket.  I also never have the power to walk into HR and say ""Hey, give this guy a 20% raise, he's earned it. Oh, and why not do the same for the rest of my team while you're at it?""  In fact, I have very little control and even a counter is just leverage for any manager to get traction on the subject.  2. Seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled ""top performer"" is underpaid.  I can assure you that that isn't the case.  Many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands.  Go ahead, tear me apart for this, it's just the truth...3. Remember employment is a mutual agreement.  Everything is in play.  If you don't like what you do or what you get paid, talk with your feet.  There is nothing wrong with that.

Many laser printers do an excellent job on photos and they're getting better, but ink is still king. You still have options. I mostly despise how the companies are gouging consumers.

8szqi8,Edenspawn,LPT: Never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.,Careers & Work,"It may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.Edit: Couple of things that have come up1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is ""Seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.",961,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/8szqi8/lpt_never_take_a_problem_to_your_boss_until_you/,32135

a4fbct,DarthPikachoo,LPT request : Do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.,Clothing,"As a dry cleaner, I can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. If a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. It take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. That is if all the stains came out on the first try. Most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. And that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.Usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time.

btqqyk,,LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike,Traveling,"**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.The things I have in mine include:\- Survival heating blanket\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter\- Whistle\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)\- Critical meds and bandages\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)\- Compass (if you're able to use it)\- Paracord\- Knife\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).\- Iodine tabs for water\- Beef jerky\- Energy gel**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",1684,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/btqqyk/lpt_bring_a_24hour_survival_kit_on_even_the/,40016

With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.1) Not understand the other person's argument2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument...Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  Something like, ""Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?""Now this has several benefits.  --First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.

Pause the argument and ask ""Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.

Not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. And that's ok. But for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point.

Second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. And you know what? That's fantastic! If you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! You bake that cake!

For some extra help / elucidation:-	I found this very helpful when I was starting my career. The biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out “on paper” to better see where things need to change, where I didn’t know all I could know, and where others may struggle in the future.-	I am indeed now a director. Our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. It’s those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; I can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. As a manager, it’s a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I’m never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it’s because they’ve found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.-	Most importantly, where I’m from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they’ve been forced to “work themselves out of a job” then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it’s not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you’re in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren’t so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I’ve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation.

e0eqyz,BleedBluePunk,LPT TIPS: What you should never to bring to a dry cleaners,Clothing,"I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.EDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.DOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processingCOMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.SPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.WEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.LEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.&#x200B;WORTH IT:MEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.WOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.D/C Only items - suits, silk shirts, cashmere sweaters, etc.Oil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.Also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.Bottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.  If your item cannot be pressed, you are often paying more for an item you could be doing yourself.",1329,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e0eqyz/lpt_tips_what_you_should_never_to_bring_to_a_dry/,47071

e5iz4j,starbuilt,"LPT: Teach yourself to not touch your face throughout the day - you’ll get sick less, as hand to face/mouth contact is one of the most common routes for microbial transmission.",Miscellaneous,"EDIT: Some information to prevent myself from having to facepalm in response to some of these comments.For a complete overview of the pathogenesis of the rhinovirus (a virus responsible for the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses) check out [this article](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/pats.201006-039RN). Some key excerpts are:- “The most common way to ‘‘catch a cold’’ is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.”- “It is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.”Hence, this LPT. It’s based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one’s hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes). The study ""Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study."" specifically concludes that ""infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands"" led to a ""substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection"" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk). In the article ""Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu"" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like:- ""To infect someone, these particles don’t have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface — eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!""- ""Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can’t stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes.""A 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled ""TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES"" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected. The 2015 study ""Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers"" states ""person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes."" and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.I could go on and on but I think at this point it's on the Redditor to do their own reading.",1700,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/e5iz4j/lpt_teach_yourself_to_not_touch_your_face/,46347

I figured I’d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn’t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don’t know how many people I’ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it….ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that’s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don’t need to spend a lot, as they’ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don’t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there’s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it’s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they’re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn’t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven’t passed, then it’s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there’s a problem that isn’t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what’s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don’t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You’ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it’s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.For reference, here’s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)Here’s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It’s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)If you listen closely, you’ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.If the car you’re looking at doesn’t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don’t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you’re looking at with something like “YYYY Make Model clear flood” or  “YYYY Make Model disable fuel pump” and see if there’s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don’t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you’re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it’s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it’s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford’s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That’s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven’t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That’s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that’s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That’s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don’t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you’re SOL there.4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it’s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they’ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It’s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that’s better. Indy’s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that’s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that’s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don’t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn’t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can’t see?8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they’re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn’t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They’ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They’ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you’re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you’re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don’t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it’s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you’re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it’s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It’s also pretty important. You’ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it’s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that’s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it’s adding, but sometimes it’s subtracting). I don’t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.So what you’re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it’s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You’re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find “short term fuel trim” and “long term fuel trim”. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%Let’s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You’re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the “bank” or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one “side” so you’ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you’ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don’t be alarmed if you’re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn’t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you’ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let’s take a look at some examples on a V8:STFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6LTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That’s pretty good.STFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3LTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that’s good.STFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7LTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That’s not good. Walk away from this one.Here's one more that's a littlte different:STFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20LTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.13. Last and not least, don’t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don’t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you’re worried about is no big deal, it’s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it’s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn’t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don’t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents’ cars, friends’ cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you’re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won’t forget anything.&#x200B;EDIT7 - I'm putting this above my other edits so it gets seen. I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.&#x200B;EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.&#x200B;EDIT2 - Fixed some formatting&#x200B;EDIT3 - Thanks for all the replies and awards.

ehafa2,r00girl,LPT; De-Escalating a Karen,Social,"TL:DR; when you’re a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren’t comfortable engaging the aggressor. At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don’t normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier’s curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don’t have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.Edit; For those in the comments saying I should have called the guy out; I am 5 feet tall and somewhat introverted. Confronting this person for his rude behavior was not something I could have handled well.  I do not trust people to not be violent and I preferred not to draw any attention to myself.

U.S. healthcare really shouldn’t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I’ve mentioned, they’ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement. Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren’t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There’s a chance you’ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there’s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don’t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no “propaganda” or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation.

This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it.

It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all.

If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how ""anything"" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere.

I usually can spot a scam. Today, I didn't.  So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought.  Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period.

To clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info.  1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system.  2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card ""that was hacked"". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to ""lock"" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into.  3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff.  4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.) 5. Lastly, thank you all for all the kind words and reassurances. It did all turn out fine in the end.

They are cheap and they dont take up much space so whenever I change bags or backpacks I always ensure there is a pack of cards in there somewhere. I cannot tell you how often they have been useful!If you end up stuck somewhere unexpected for an extended period of time, a pack of cards is a great way to keep everyone occupied and happy and make the time go quickly. The options for games are limitless! You will also be thought of favourably as the prudent one for having the cards with you in the first place!This can also be great as an ice breaker if you are with people you dont really know but are stuck with through circumstance. Additionally if there are any worries or anxieties in the room eg. power cut or locked in somewhere for example, playing cards can take a lot of people's minds off of their unease and lift the tension.Have a bored child on a train or waiting room with no toys? A pack of cards to a child can literally be hours of entertainment, you can practice numbers, magic, play snap, build card houses...My husband is in the military and also swears by this tip - they take cards with them everywhere as you never know when you may have to wait around for hours and need something to do to keep boredom at bay.One final tip I would say that make sure you know a few basic card games you could simply explain to others if needed to get things going but one of the good things about this would be if you do get stuck somewhere and have hours to kill with a colleague/friend/stranger, you also have the means to learn games from them and get talking etc! I know this is not going to go changing lives but hopefully may be helpful to someone :-)EDIT: I have been out today and came back and saw all of these wonderful comments!

fkv8ww,EricPro21,"LPT: Since there are reports that the United States Government will possibly be sending money by check or direct deposit to American citizens ""shortly,"" the FTC has made a list of three important tips to keep in mind.",,"The details are still being worked out, but there are a few really important things to know:1. The government will not ask you to pay anything up front to get this money. No fees. No charges. No nothing.2. The government will not call to ask for your Social Security number, bank account, or credit card number. Anyone who does is a scammer.3. These reports of checks aren’t yet a reality. Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer.Predict that the scammers are gearing up to take advantage of this.  So, remember: no matter what this payment winds up being, only scammers will ask you to pay to get it. If you spot one of these scams, please tell the Federal Trade Commission: [www.ftc.gov/complaint](http://www.ftc.gov/complaint). WThe FTC encourages you to keep up to date with the latest Coronavirus-related scams at [www.ftc.gov/coronavirus](http://www.ftc.gov/coronavirus) or by [signing up to get these consumer alerts. ](http://www.ftc.gov/subscribe)FTC notice reference: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/03/checks-government?utm\_source=govdelivery](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2020/03/checks-government?utm_source=govdelivery)Edit 3: WOW THIS BLEW UP, THAT'S AWESOME!

I would like to also point out some things...I’m not sure of the numbers but people fall for the classic “CONGRATULATIONS MR/MRS; PRINCE of x country wants to give you a MILLION dollars!!!!! if you give us your information” all of the time. And that is 100% a lie, but people STILL FALL FOR IT. Think about this.. the news is telling people the government is giving them $1000. So when someone calls requesting their information, the news told them its happening so it has to be true. Like, holy shit people! This is going to get so many people and it’s not getting the attention it deserves on a national level! Please please please spread this!

fl8lms,Slartibradfast,LPT Advice on managing extended periods away from the World,,"I was a submariner for 6 years with multiple deployments of 6 months and other extended underways of multiple months with short in-port stints in between. In that time I had to develop coping strategies for dealing with the isolation and loss of social contact with the outside World.Here's what I learned:1) Hold fast to whatever is waiting for you on the other side. It doesn't matter it feels foolish, or whether there is certainty of it happening exactly as you plan in the end. Hope can deliver us from the darkest of days.2) Be goofy AF. Crack jokes. Be odd. Let your mind wander when it needs to. You need to let that pent up energy out often. Channel it into whatever creative nonsense you can think of.3) Food is fuel. Eat what you need, but ration the good stuff. You'll need the good rewarding pick-me-ups spaced out in time.4) Make a time-keeping record / log. Put all your thoughts, poems, songs, rants, etc in it. Bonus if you can collaborate on it with others.5) Share your thoughts with others and commiserate often. We are all in the suck, and it doesn't matter how much worse anyone has it. Your feelings are valid, and need acknowledgement.6) Write letters to loved ones, and record videos for them to watch (and facetime now that that tech is available). I always felt special when someone went to the trouble of making something like that for me, and letting me know they care. And I felt good making them too.7) Have a project. Something long term that you have to work on gradually. Education, making, hobby, art, etc.8) Make and share playlists for your various moods, and embrace the moods you feel fully. Get all the joy, rage, pain, and everything out. Scream if you need to. Don't worry about looking crazy, because the World is crazy, and we are a reflection of it.9) Get to know people that you would never talk to in your normal routine. They will change your life.10) Reward your accomplishments. Because you are a survivor, thrill hunter, a champion, and a badass.11) Be a dick as little as possible, and share whatever you can.",782,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fl8lms/lpt_advice_on_managing_extended_periods_away_from/,33126

That being said, I am not a vet, I don’t know your pets history, and therefore the best bet for you and your dog is to reach out to them regarding any advice or further information. Veterinarians are not just there for medical advice; they work with animals every single day and can have some seriously helpful advice, and most of the time it’s free of charge if you are already in the office for a checkup or speaking over the phone/email.This post was intended to curb what will likely be a massive change in you and your puppies daily routine because of the outbreak. There will be yet another massive change when you go back to your old routine, perhaps back to work on a daily basis, and it’s important to consider all the affects this could have on your puppy and their progress.I also recommend playing brain games with your dog during isolation, and also in general— look them up, they’re fun and rewarding. My dog likes hide and seek and anything involving treat rewards haha. Most vets (and commenters here) also recommend crate training. This is of course ideal, and better than going to another room and letting your dog claw at the door, but right now not everyone has access to a crate so just use best judgement and speak to your vet when possible.

The subject line included my username and a password that I have (stupidly) been using on various unimportant websites since I was a teenager. The email was looong and written using those weird characters spam emails often use, but it was fairly well written grammatically. Essentially, I was told that this person (or human equivalent of decades old pond scum) had managed to gain access to my phone, had recorded me, and unless I paid it $1900 was going to send that recording to all of my contacts on messenger, Facebook, and email. It said I had a certain amount of time to pay up, and that even if I went to the police there was no way the email could be traced. It even went so far as to say there was a specific pixel in the email showing that I had read it. Thankfully my boyfriend was with me and quick to notice it had to be a scam since I don’t even have Facebook. He was immediately able to find an [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/02/sextortion-bitcoin-scam-makes-unwelcome-return/amp/) online to confirm that this “sextortion” scam has been going on for the past couple years. The wording of my own little special delivery of an email was almost verbatim the wording of the email in the article. As someone who has always considered myself fairly savvy to recognizing a scam, I have to say this one really got to me. Even knowing it’s a scam, I still can’t help but feel violated.

Be Paranoid.,Careers & Work,"Got a big presentation?  Got a big event you are running?  Got a once-in-a-lifetime shoot to perform or make a pitch to the powers that be?  Do you have a do-or-die moment for your job, company, or personal life?Then it is absolutely vital that you do a dry run test days before the event and then again the day of the event.  I can not tell you how often I've seen people screw the pooch or shoot themselves in the foot all because they didn't completely 100% test EVERYTHING prior to some important thing they had to do.Not having batteries, not having the right cord to connect your laptop to some projector, not having the right software to connect your system to another system, having some software update change your settings and screw up your program, forgetting to account for timezone differences, having the incorrect phone number or web meeting address, being unsure as to who is doing what, missing some widget...THe list of simple shit that can go wrong and screw you is almost infinite.   But by doing the test a few days before you force yourself to actually put eyeballs on all the things you ""should"" have and to make sure everything actually works.  And most importantly, you will give yourself the chance to rush order any part that you need at the last minute (you can get almost anything in 2 to 3 days).There is nothing worse than sitting at the front of the podium having to explain to your audience that a major part of your whatever can't be shown because you are missing a $5 widget or didn't realize that an Apple product won't connect right to a PC product...",736,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/g70mjs/lpt_you_must_do_an_absolute_100_dry_run_test_of/,35905

g7orfn,,LPT: Don’t say anything negative about someone’s appearance that they cannot change/fix in 20 seconds.,Social,"I read this somewhere online years ago and it has stuck with me. I love this tip because it is a simple way to make sure you can be helpful without being socially awkward! For example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. On the other hand, if you say “oh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering” or “you’ve got a huge pimple”, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it’s just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.Hope this helps someone! :)EDIT: wow, didn’t expect this to take off so fast! So, just for clarity - 20 seconds is a rough guide to indicate a relatively quick and easy fix. Take it with a grain of salt, it could be a minute, just use common sense as to what the situation is, if you know the person etc.Also, if someone has shit/wet/bled somewhere, or something of that nature, discreetly tell them and offer help to get somewhere to fix themselves up.Basically, be a decent human being. If you’re close to the person, then you should be able to judge what to say and when based on how you know they will react and process it.",1094,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/g7orfn/lpt_dont_say_anything_negative_about_someones/,43385

And it's $22.40 cheaper on Amazon, Walmart & Overstock---Edit 1:Here are a few methods to reverse image search. I'm sure there are more.Desktop:* Right-click an image & select ""Search Google for this image"" (maybe this only words in certain browsers, not entirely sure)* Or you can use [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) & click the camera icon to upload a pic or paste the URL of the imageMobile:* Use Chrome and hold down on an image & select ""Search Google for This Image""* Use the Google app & open Google Lens* Use [tineye.com](http://www.tineye.com)---Edit 2: Added the current prices for that lamp since prices will change in the future.Also a couple more notes:* Some commenters let me know this practice is called ""white labeling."" I'm assuming it's legal because the suppliers agree for Wayfair to do it when they agree to sell on Wayfair.* This doesn't always work; sometimes Wayfair has it cheapest. So you can also try this tip the opposite way if you're about to buy something at Target/Home Depot/Macy's/etc, you can reverse image search to see if Wayfair has it cheaper under a fake name.* Wayfair creates their own photos/renderings sometimes, so you may need to try a few photos.* Since Wayfair, Joss & Main, AllModern, & Birch Lane are all owned by the same company, they often offer the same product on multiple sites with different prices. Sometimes the names are the same, sometimes different. So be sure to check their other sites too before purchasing.    For example, this 5' x 8' rug is on all four sister sites:    *  Wayfair: [Handmad Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug by Wade Logan](https://www.wayfair.com/rugs/pdp/wade-logan-handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-w002904453.html?piid=836378768)  - $143.99    * Joss & Main: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.jossandmain.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $158.39    * Birch Lane: [Handmade Braided Gray Indoor / Outdoor Area Rug](https://www.birchlane.com/rugs/pdp/handmade-braided-gray-indoor-outdoor-area-rug-wdln2358.html?piid=23573723) - $144    * AllModern: [Walmsley Gray Area Rug](https://www.allmodern.com/rugs/pdp/walmsley-gray-area-rug-a000204971.html?piid=2002933957) - $150    So you may think you're getting the best deal at Wayfair, but reverse image search helps you find that it's really called the ""Lefebvre"" rug made by a company called ""nuLOOM"" & you can easily find out it's sold at [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/pep/nuLOOM-Lefebvre-Casual-Braided-Salt-Pepper-5-ft-x-8-ft-Indoor-Outdoor-Area-Rug-HJFV01C-508/206984584), [Target](https://www.target.com/p/braided-lefebvre-rug-nuloom/-/A-51692002?preselect=51529119#lnk=sametab), [Kohl's](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2851085/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-terra-solid-rug.jsp?skuid=63960126), [Lowe's](https://www.lowes.com/pd/nuLOOM-Salt-and-Pepper-Indoor-Outdoor-Coastal-Area-Rug-Common-5-x-8-Actual-5-ft-W-x-8-ft-L/1001110766), [JCPenney](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/nuloom-braided-lefebvre-salt-and-pepper-rug/ppr5007334058), [Macy's](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/nuloom-festival-braided-lefebvre-area-rug?ID=10572683), & [Bed Bath & Beyond](https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/nuloom-festival-lefebvre-braided-rug-in-black-white/3321002?skuId=77145577) for anywhere from $111.92 (Home Depot) to $367.20 (Macy's) - in which case you'd obviously go with Home Depot.",1139,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/g9szg9/lpt_reverse_image_search_before_purchasing_from/,37342

When the interviewer asks the question: what salary are you looking for?, instead of listing what you’re expecting ask them instead. I always start with explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about experience to “this position”). Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. This also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of under selling yourself! (If they’re expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they’re not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).Edit to add: a bunch of commenters are making valid points. Do your research, know your worth and what the worth of the position is. If the company lowballs you, ask for more if you feel comfortable. Salaries are often part of a negotiation, and if you know you deserve more then advocate for it. Prove to them that you’re worth the investment, because if they’re not willing to pay you what you deserve (provided they can AFFORD to do so, some businesses just don’t have the funds to meet the same pay as another business) then you have to consider if they’re worth your time. Does the money matter for you to accept the job, and if the answer is yes then get it!Edit #2: Thank you to everyone for the awards!

With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.A leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.Exercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you.

All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people?There is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.I don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down. Embarrassing someone to give them thicker skin is a massive gamble between ended up with someone being able to laugh at themself and someone who is insecure, or at worst fuels the fire of an anxiety disorder.

You need to get 20 pts to get into VP (Voie Prégymnasiale) basically sends you automatically to college/HS (idk lol) once you finish 11th grade. Anyways I realized that nothing that I ever did or say would bring my father back. So after grieving for what seemed like and eternity I decided to make him proud instead of failing.Here’s how I did it.After my worst year in school ever I went back in and started to put in some effort. I paid attention, I studied hard at home. When exams where approaching I studied like never before. (4+ hours every day) I got very good results from this. Finished the year with 21 /24 pts and got into VP.I also had to deal with a new school and I had to try and make new friends which was not easy.In summary:In the beginning it will hurt. A lot. But overtime you will learn that it’s more important to shoot for the sky’s rather than fall to the ground. I kept my motivation and dignity to help myself and make my father proud.In the end it paid off.Edit: Wow! I did NOT expect that to do so well. Words could not express how grateful I am to see the response in general let alone the awards. I’ll try my best to respond to all of you but no promises. Thank you so much.Edit 2: so apparently my message didn’t really come across the full way. Yes a dead person can not feel pride, my point is:Make yourself proud and do what you think is best for you and do what you *think* would make a deceased loved one proud. This (in my case) worked for me but every person has their different way of grieving and their different way of going about things going forward. Also try your best to pull yourself up no matter how hard life throws you down. I know some people just can’t because of their own guilt or sorrow but at least try.If you fail I wish you can one day succeed in all of your endeavors and dreams.Oh and to all of you people that live to downvote comments that make me feel *actually* betterSeriously, fuck you.",798,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/i81pg9/lpt_if_a_loved_one_passes_away_make_them_proud/,42163

I now understand how clean people are clean, they simply are literally always cleaning. The best way to be clean and organized is to incorporate cleaning into your lifestyle. There's no need to take time away from your day to clean simply adhere to this rule and you will quickly see how easy it is to incorporate cleaning into your daily lifestyle.Enter my room, pick up two pieces of clothes. Enter my kitchen, put away a couple dry dishes. Leave my car and take two pieces of trash with me. No overwhelming three hour cleans just an incredibly simple and easy commitment.

ilrdua,frontendben,"LPT: When negotiating a salary for a new job, always ask them what their range is. If they tell you 'we don't have a range' they're almost always lying. HR and finance will almost never sign off hiring a new employee without a budget being in place.",Careers & Work,"As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made as possible. The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.Once you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.However – and this is the important bit – if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.To get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a £6k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers – all above the original top end of their budget).Now the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.If the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful – especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process. Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them.And even if that isn't the case, consider carefully whether you really want to work for a company where there is a culture of lying to you before you've even been hired.",1571,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ilrdua/lpt_when_negotiating_a_salary_for_a_new_job/,48723

It sucked watching the kind, warm, and generous man I knew become a shell of his former self.   During his decline, he showed all the hallmarks of the disease: forgetting family faces and names, telling stories about false memories, and, in the end, a bit of belligerence (the kind you might typically see in a toddler).   Throughout his decline, I saw my family approach it in one of two ways: some would try to correct his mistakes over and over (to no avail), and some would just roll with the punches.   Playing along with things in the moment always seemed to keep him more centered and grounded. Not only did it help calm him down, it made those painful visits a little less so by knowing he felt comforted by my validating his reality, and not trying to yank him out of whatever timeline/alternate universe he was visiting.   A simple example would be if he asked where his (long dead) mother was, I would just say ""she's visiting with your sister and will be back soon."" What good would correcting him do? Then he'd have to re-live that trauma of losing his mom all over again, possibly many times a day.   Or when he would say something outlandish like, ""I used to be a senator, you know"" I would just say, ""oh that's right, I forgot all about that, tell me more!""   I have to give credit to a [TEDMED talk](https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=526821) that I saw describing this whole approach, many years ago.

iqd44x,PUNCH-THE-SUN,LPT: What to do if it's too late to evacuate from wildfires.,,"G'day mate! Looks bloody awful over in America, those wildfires are right nasty. Lucky, us Aussies have been surviving through all that and much worse for at least a couple centuries, and I'm here to give you guys the inside info on how to survive. 1 - If you live on an upslope, ridge, or narrow forested road, get the fuck out early - no help will come. People here who stayed then changed their minds later, and couldn't escape because trees fell within minutes and blocked exit routes.Firefighters were either unable to get in, or were forbidden due to extreme risk of being cut off themselves - 1200 litres of water in a Cat7 is like pissing into a hurricane, especially if you're up on a ridge.2 - if actually caught and unable to escape. dig in and cover with  DRY WOOLEN BLANKETS!Please fill your bathtub before it hits - water tanks will melt real fast and you'll have no water - the thing that MIGHT make the difference between life and death could be as simple as layers of wool blankets,  a low sheltered concrete corner, some sheets of tin, some DRY wool blankets, and one moist towel to protect from radiant heat.Wet clothing or sheets are inferior to a wool blanket and you will boil alive. Do not cover any yourself in anything wet!3 - If defending your house - wool or cotton long sleeves and leather boots, and wear LEATHER GLOVES if possible. You can throw burning stuff back but without gloves, no way.4 - Remember that the only safe area to run to is often INTO an area already burnt - you can also survive by having a shallow grave and laying in that under dry blankets, a layer of wet stuff and tin, and breathe through a wet cloth to avoid suffocation. You'll collapse real fucking fast without oxygen and remember also, many houses are made with plastics and toxic gas-causing materials so.... yeah.... stay safe out there and honestly, if you live on a ridge or uphill slope... run now.  Your life is worth more than stuff.5 - If you think you can defend, don't forget to protect your water tank and exposed poly lines - if that goes, you're fucked. People on gravity feed systems, this is your weak point. We were lucky enough to have a small Honda pump and Cat7, but our tank was on fire several times - if that had gone, we'd be gone.  Remember this, especially if on a bush block with some tank uphill off in the scrub. If you're not gonna be able to save that tank, forget about it.  You're going to lose your house, get out now.6 - Remember, fire can move up to 400km (250miles) per hour uphill. If you change your mind and live on a ridge, you are quite likely fucked.  Don't die for stuff.  Escape, and we can hunt down the corrupt fucks who made this happen later. Channel that anger to the ones who sold us out and gave away our water and our future to line their own pockets.Stay safe America!: EDIT :I had no idea this'd blow up so much, and it's great to see so many people invested in keeping fire safe, you're all fuckin legends 💪 and thanks to everyone who's put forward awards. I'm not sure what they do, but I appreciate y'all care so much.: POINTS WORTH CLARIFYING :A Cat7 is a type of firefighting engine available in Australia. Not sure what your American equivalent would be.NEVER use water to cover your blankets or yourself, EVER. Use it as an external barrier to embers on the outermost towels.Actually I'm a chick ✌️Large bodies of water are good to venture out into if necessary, but keep in mind you need a decent level of physical fitness to maintain treading water whilst also inhaling smoke at the same time.NEVER use synthetics or anything with a synthetic blend.

If you don’t like the offer you get, hire an independent appraiser.",Miscellaneous,"EDIT: this only applies to the USA and varies by state My wife’s 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee was recently rear ended. After having about $5k worth of damage repaired, I filed a diminished value claim. Progressive Insurance (the insurance of the person who was at fault) offered me $400. I said no. They then offered $600. I said no. The body shop who fixed the car recommended an independent appraiser who they said almost always gets you more money. I paid him $300 for an appraisal report that showed that the value based on auctions etc is between 2-3k. I sent that report to Progressive. They reviewed it and then had their appraiser do their own research and then contacted my appraiser to negotiate a “settlement”. We agreed on $2100. The independent appraiser told me not enough people know about diminished value claims. He said if you have a later model car with under X miles (varies by state), it’s a no brainer claim but never accept the insurance company’s offer because they will low ball you a lot until you bring them evidence otherwise. All this cost me was $300 and 45 min of my time to have the appraiser see and take photos of the vehicle.EDIT 1: As someone posted below, the ability to get a claim does depend on the make and model of your car and it's value. I should add that the independent adjuster I talked to gave me a ballpark value of what he thought the claim should be before I ever paid him a penny. He did say in some cases, it may not be worth it but knowing the details of my car (age, mileage, condition), I was getting low balled. You mileage may vary.EDIT 2: As many have stated, Diminished Value laws vary by state so please check state laws before filing as to not waste your time (or money). Every state may have different time frames for when you can file. EDIT 3: This is based on my experience in America. I have no idea how this works globally outside the US, if at all.EDIT 4: wow. Did not expect this to blow up like it did. As I stated above, you mileage may vary, it varies by state so do your homework, and my experience was specific to the US.

When the only way out is through, turn and face the discomfort, take a deep breath and walk towards it. This is neuroscience-backed, see full post.",Miscellaneous,"The following is from a Harvard Business School neuroscience based behavioural course I did.Your brain is your hype man, and tries very hard to prove you right using emotions as feedback. Once you decide on your goal, emotions are the hints your brain uses to help you decide whether a certain situation HELPS or HINDERS your progression towards that goal. In turn, this influences your behaviour. Thoughts - Feelings - Behaviour. Nothing is inherently good or bad, it is all relative to what you are trying to achieve. Read that sentence again.If your goal is avoidance, then any progression or confrontation is going to feel very uncomfortable because your brain will be going ""nope, this is bad. This is not what you wanted. Sending bad feedback."" You can just as easily shift your goal (this is what mindset is, and it IS up to you) and in turn, change your brain's response to the stimulus around you (emotions). Even if it is an uncomfortable situation, your brain will recognise that it's helping you achieve your goal, so the feedback it gives you (emotions) will be much more positive. It all starts with what you want to achieve and if you don't know, then spend some time figuring that out.

Westfield is a chain of shopping centres in the UK, AU, & US. In the moment of panic, I went to the bathroom, I realise too it probably wasn’t the best space to go.I was at Westfield pretty late writing my thesis paper \~23:00, and after I got up to leave, I noticed the only other guy in the area leave as well. Typically I'm the only left because I stay back past dinner and had thought he would naturally just leave when all the restaurants closed (Westfield closed at midnight, and all shops were closed.) I got some creepy vibes from him so I walked some loops from L3 to L1 and he was still following me. I went to the bathroom to calm myself, spent about 20mins there and called an uber (normally I walk home because it's pretty safe at night, but I felt if I left the centre where there were no cameras it would be safer to catch a ride). When I came out, I thought I must've spent long enough in there, and he had left but he was sitting on a bench obscured by the elevators ahead. I walked past him as discreetly as possible, towards the parking lot but he got up and followed me too. So I went back round to the supermarket, the only place I knew would still be open and walked around aimlessly until I saw a couple walk in for some late-night grocery shopping. I was afraid to inconvenience them but ended up asking if they could accompany me whilst I waited. I explained I'd been followed and didn't feel safe, and if they could walk with me to the car park where my uber would arrive. They agreed, and once it came, I thanked them and yeeted out of there.If I had walked home alone maybe something bad could have happened to me, maybe not. All I know is that I didn't feel safe.

Between the flight time, airport wait time, and time to get to the airport, it could easily be eight hours since they last had a proper meal, even with a direct flight.To those that are hostile towards the idea that you might consider doing an additional nice thing for someone on top of an initial nice thing: You don't have to do it, and the person isn't obligated to eat it.

kaj4ff,wheresyourpickle,"LPT: if you call a suicide hotline and get put on hold, it’s not that we don’t care about you! We also don’t read off of scripts. Other misconceptions below.",Social,"I have worked at a suicide hotline for about 2 years now and I have found that there are many misconceptions about suicide and crisis hotline workers and volunteers.  I can’t speak for every organization, but I hope that I can address a few of the general concerns that I see now so that you feel more comfortable calling.1.  “Why did I get put in a queue? Do they not care that I’m about to kill/hurt myself?”  We absolutely DO CARE! Please, please stay on the line.  At my organization, when you call you first talk to a “crisis screener” who’s job it is to take down whatever information you want to give them and then send you to one of two queues.  One queue is for people actively wanting to commit suicide and the other is for people in general crisis but not suicidal.  This is where some people get stuck on hold for a while because we are actively taking calls from the queue as they come in.  Every night is different and every shift is different. Sometimes I’ll get 3 calls in 4 hours and I can really take my time with each person.  Other times, we have 10 people waiting in the queue but I still want to give each person their respective time to de-escalate.  We can also see if someone has dropped from the queue and it always makes me sad to see that someone hung up.  I want to talk to you. We all want to help.2. “Workers just talk from a script so there’s no point in calling”.  This is absolutely not true.  When you talk to me, I’m given a blank notepad and that’s it.  Through extensive training, we learn about ways to help you de-escalate your thoughts, open up and feel comfortable, and help you specifically identify what you are feeling in a crisis moment.  Our onboarding teachers really focused on how every caller is different and every situation is case-dependent. I would never boil down your experiences to a script. 3. “I don’t want to call again tonight because I’ve already called once and I’m going to bother them”.  Please feel comfortable calling as many times as you need if you are in active crisis.  Most likely you won’t even be talking to the same phone worker as everyone goes into the same queue.  I would say about 50% of my calls are people who I regularly hear from every day/week - they say their name or I recognize their voices.  20% are likely callers who have already called once in the night and need to talk again.  This is perfectly fine and I’m happy to explore what worked for you last time you called and what can work again this time.4. “They’re going to hang up on me”.  We are not allowed to hang up on anyone (and I wouldn’t want to) unless they are being abusive to us or won’t let us speak.  We get a surprising amount of prank calls and people who call just to scream at us.  THAT BEING SAID - I have accidentally hung up on people before.  I feel absolutely horrible when this happens but I hope that everyone knows that they should call back.  If I am actively talking to you or you are telling a story and we get disconnected, know that I didn’t get bored and hang up. Something definitely happened on the worker’s line.5. “I don’t want to call because they will record what I’m saying and it will be used against me later.”  From my knowledge, most privately and gov owned phone lines do not record phone calls.  Some that I am unaware of may have different standards but at least with the ones I’m aware of in my state and National level, we all make it very clear before your call that we are 100% anonymous.  We don’t record conversations or calls - I don’t even think our phones can do that.  Most times I take notes so that I can remember your name and specific hardships that you mention but we have shredders all around the office to discard those after we hang up.  You are also welcomed to not disclose your name if you have something really personal that you feel scared to let out.  If you are ever unsure about what is being recorded, please ask your phone worker and they will tell you what your organization allows. 6. “My problems are too big for them to handle”.  We have heard everything, trust me.  Everything from teens wanting to shoot up their schools to people who are having affairs to people calling us so that they can masterbate.  Nothing you say will surprise us or be too much for us to talk you through.  I’m happy to answer any more questions in the comments if you have additional things that you are curious or unsure about.  I greatly recommend that you print out your local crisis line’s number and hang it on your fridge and enter it to your phone.  You have no idea how many calls we get from children/teens who got our number from their parents/friend’s parents either directly or indirectly.If you are looking to find a hotline in your country, please refer to this link: https://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html.  I recommend if you are in the United States that you look up a free, 24 hour hotline in your city or state (rather than the National hotline) as they will be more likely to have a smaller queue and can also give you strong resources within your zip code or area.  You can save this number for if you are having an emergency.  Never hesitate to call the National hotline either, though which can be found at that link.Please call us.  We are ready and eager to help.———————Edit:  concerning mandated reporting to 911 because many people are asking about it, every organization is different.  For mine, we are mandated reporters in cases where people are in active suicide or planning to hurt someone else.  We don’t call the police but we do call 911 and we have no control over what they decide is best in that situation (whether they should get cops involved or just emergency services.). However people saying that they feel suicidal is far from being in active suicide.  Even people that have access to suicidal methods, like if someone has a gun or pills in their home, we will not call unless they are actively trying to use them to kill themselves.  De-escalation is our main priority.That being said, if we do need to call the 911, my call center and certain others have no way of knowing where the caller is since we are a 100% anonymous call center.  Some organizations may have trackers or can give your number away but we either have to convince people to call 911 themselves so that their location can be shared or we have to talk it out of them.For example, I got a call one time from a lady who had just taken a bunch of sleeping pills and just wanted someone talk to while she died.  Through about 20 minutes of conversation I was able to get her to tell me where she was located and so emergency services were sent.  This is pretty rare and it only is required maybe once every couple of months.  Many people are sharing stories of themselves getting hurt by police and thrown into mental wards. I know that this is common and this is why my organization really doesn’t call 911 much.  Again, I cannot control if the 911 operator decides if the police should be involve or not and if this does happen if you get taken to a psych evaluation at a hospital.  My job in that moment is to save your life and remember, it’s not a choice - I’m a mandated reporter to 911 which means I’m required to call.  I try HARD AS HELL to prevent this from happening though but some situations are dire.  I really recommend asking whatever hotline you are calling what their mandated reporting requirements are or looking on their website under terms and conditions where it is laid out in writing.  Most times if people are in very bad mental crisis that we cannot completely de escalate in a 30 min call, we can offer to send a mobile crisis team to your location. This involves sending two trained mental health professionals to an address that you give us and consent to them coming out to.  This is fairly common and probably happens around once every two hours on the line but it still not the most preferred conclusion.  We work very hard to help you on that phone anonymously and quickly.  I wouldn’t want anyone to be turned away from getting help because they’re scared about what me as a phone worker is going to do.If you are ever concerned about what is reported, being recorded, etc... please ask your phone worker.  We are legally required to be transparent to you.  Thank you!———————Edit #2:  here are some additional answers to questions I’ve been getting in the comments:1.  “Should I still call the line if I am just depressed and not suicidal?”  There are two different types of lines that I wish were spread around more clearly.  One is a suicide-only hotline.  These workers will only answer and respond to people who are actively suicidal or having suicide ideation right now.  Many of the negative stories in the comments have people saying that they were hung up on because they weren’t “that depressed”.  I can’t diminish your experience and I’m sorry that it happened.  In the future, if you know that you are not actively suicidal but still need someone to call, call a “crisis hotline”.  These are also trained volunteers and workers who deal with general crises.  Things like if you are depressed, having anxiety, want to vent, need to cry, need to get resources for drug addiction or domestic abuse etc... this is the place to call.  It’s also okay if you call the crisis line and later end up talking about suicidal thoughts, it happens more than you know.2. “How do I get a job as a phone worker or volunteer?”  The way I did it was that I went on my local hotline’s page by searching ones near me on google.  There was a tab that said volunteer and I filled out my email and a small application on there.  Within a week, a supervisor reached out to me and asked me to fill out more information involving sending them my resume, filling out a 4 page document on why I want to work there, and undergoing a background check.  Another week or so later, I got instructions on how to join an orientation where they told me more about the work and we could choose if we were still interested or not.  After a year of being a volunteer, I applied to a bachelors-level paid position at my hotline in which I oversee other volunteers if they have questions or concerns about calls.  My organization has bachelors and masters level positions.  I got my B.S. in physiology.3. I want to say thank you to everyone who is sharing their bad experiences here as well as their good ones.  It’s important that organizations learn from people’s shitty experiences so that we can all get better as a whole.  I’ve been suicidal and have attempted in my lifetime.  I’ve called a suicide hotline and had a bad experience where I felt like I was wasting their time. I also called a couple times after that and was connected to the best people I have ever had the experience talking to.  They saved my life.  I applied to help because I want to make sure that everyone has a good, or atleast fair, experience when they are speaking to me as a phone worker.  There are a couple of things that I recommend if you want to get the best chance at having good experience calling a phone line.  For one, I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, National phones lines have longer queues and they are likely rushed as phone workers.  They’re not a bad resource at all but if you are of sound mind, I recommend searching and saving a smaller hotline’s number around your area that deals with suicide or crisis that way you can have them in your phone when you need them.  Next, if you are concerned about if giving away your information will be tracked or reported... ASK.  Always ask so you never feel like you were duped into having the cops called on you or your address taken.  Ask if your call is recorded, ask if your number is recorded, and ask if you can even remain anonymous.  I don’t care what information you give me about yourself, I care about helping you get through tonight.  Many of this information can be found on your hotline’s website under the terms and conditions. Read through these if you don’t want to ask.—————-I have taken a break from this account indefinitely.  I don’t know what some of you want from me. I made an informational post based on MY experiences as a phone line worker and told you all of my knowledge on how to have the best chances at a good experience because often people have bad ones.  I’ve called 911 on probably about 5 people in my whole career because they already took active measures to end their life or were planning on ending someone else’s soon.  They also knew that I was going to call and GAVE ME THEIR INFORMATION AND LOCATION because they realized that they needed in-person and immediate help that we cannot give them.  I didn’t “swat them” or “send police to their door for no reason”.  I understand that this may be a rosey organization that I work at but the advice I gave to ask questions, call smaller hotlines, and read the terms and conditions still stand for any hotline you are calling.  Take a look at their website and understand their protocol. People have been messaging me that I should kill myself, that they hope I get cancer, that I’m the reason their father/mother died, I’m the reason they got sent a 20,000 dollar medical bill, I’m the reason they were trapped in a mental health facility for 7 months, I’m the reason they got beaten up by cops, etc... How can you say these things to another human being and then complain about how your own mental health was treated?  I’ve been blamed for the actions of a huge line of decision-making people that I don’t even come in contact with at my job.  I’ve been blamed for the actions of people at other organizations who I will never meet or talk to in my life.  I have a history of depression and suicidal ideation as stated in my post, and frankly, the comments attacking me have brought up a lot of that which is why I need to go.  I’m not upset that people have had bad experiences and are sharing them, that is inevitable and encouraged as I have also had bad experiences and we need to learn from them. I’m upset that people are messaging me really horrific things and attacking me.I still want people to know that there are good organizations out there filled with people who want to help.  I know the comments here seem overwhelmingly negative but, often people who have had good or life saving experiences will not comment.  Not all hotlines are good but I hope, if you need it, you will still try to find one based on my advice above.  I wish I could bring all of you who have had bad experiences to my line and let you listen to the constant stream of people that we help for 8 hours a day, but I can’t and I realize that asking you to trust me after your personal, horrific experiences is too much to ask.  I hope that you all have found a therapist, psychiatrist, support group, or other healthcare professional or service and are working to heal from your mental health issues.  I’m still doing so myself.",1367,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kaj4ff/lpt_if_you_call_a_suicide_hotline_and_get_put_on/,43324

kk7ueu,Demonthrall22,LPT: Exercise when you don't want to,Productivity,"As a 37 year old, I look back to the single most valuable lesson I have learned in life. It was told to me in passing by an older gentleman in a community center gym locker room when I was in my twenties, about 10-15 years ago. 
I entered the locker room to change before working out and noticed he was just getting ready to leave. We made eye contact, I smiled, and asked ""How heavy are they today?"" A simple gesture of friendliness.
He smiled and said, ""Only the first couple. Motion before emotion."" 
He sort of sang it to me. Motion before emotion... Over the next decade, this attitude became capitalized, highlighted and underlined in my mindset.
Exercise is easy to avoid in life. Especially to a newbie, the thought of it is very unpleasant, intimidating and easy to ignore. 
Exercise however is an incredibly powerful tool in handling depression, stress and anxiety that life can deal you. I cannot overstate this. With regular exercise your mood improves, your ability to handle stress increases dramatically and your body performs with greater efficiency. You sleep better, you heal faster, you just feel good more often.
The ability to exercise regularly throughout the rest of your days will dictate both the quality and quantity of the life you lead.
Motion before Emotion. 
Our bodies have this beautiful built in mechanism to help us endure physical effort. When we engage in exercise, after only a few minutes our brain starts releasing feel good chemicals(endorphins) to help us cope with the effort. Our body literally comes preloaded with special drugs made to help us feel good during strenuous movement our bodies!
Motion before Emotion. Therein lies the secret key to making it happen. 
Sometimes the last thing we want to do when we are depressed or troubled is to get up and exercise. The thought is almost painful. But you must start moving before you will feel better! However awkward and foreign it feels. Your body will not release the endorphins until you get moving, but release they will! Like clockwork. You must move your body and raise your heart rate to access those chemicals which release stress, make you feel happier and desire to exercise longer.
You will feel better when you start moving, when your heart rate increases. If you are feeling depressed, anxious, stressed or are having trouble sorting through your thoughts- get up, get moving! Get out that door, go for a walk, hop on your bike, or in your car to head to the gym.
You must provide the spark. Starting to exercise is up to you. Your body has a built in fuel system to carry you through the rest. Exercising regularly will reward you in both the short and long term.
Motion before emotion!

EDIT:  Getting messages saying it is bad advice to advise not to call 911.  Let me be clear, you should call 911 for their advice and on which hospital you should go to, and if the person can't walk, obviously they need an ambulance.  But in my specific case, my parents live in the country so we would have been waiting AT LEAST 30 minutes for an ambulance to arrive, precious time to assess and load my dad into the ambulance, and then drive back into the city. In my case, it made sense to just load up and go, but we probably should have had 911 on the line while we were driving.-----Additional symptoms:Sudden NumbnessSudden ConfusionSudden Trouble-SeeingSudden Trouble-WalkingSudden Severe Headache-----Prologue:  I worked at a hospital that is a stroke center from 2010-2014 as a grunt.  Dad is a retired doctor.I went to my parent's early on Christmas Eve 2020, was helping dad put heavy stuff in the attic.  Afterward, he said he needed to vacuum but could not say the word ""vacuum"", and then said ""am I having a stroke?""   I thought, ""fuck"".  Then he said vacuum, and walked to his bedroom, and I hoped it was just a brain fart and he was fine.  Nope, he comes into living room and sits down in chair, and he can't speak.  At all.  He points to his mouth. No facial drooping.  I later learned he meant he was drooling.  I thought, ""fuck, fuck, fuck"".  I knew he was having a stroke.  Mom walked by, I said ""dad is having a stroke"".  She said ""no no no,"", and gave him an aspirin.  I said we can't wait,  we gotta go to the hospital now.  Got dad into the car and had mom drive to the stroke hospital I used to work at, in about 30ish minutes from onset of stroke.  They gave him the TPA protocal.  They said he most likely had the stroke due to him being in Atrial Fibrillation, which fired off a clot to his head.  He went up to the ICU that night, Christmas Eve.  He was able to speak that night.  The next day, Christmas Day, even better.  He was released on 12.26.20, able to speak very understandably with only a slight defect that should go away, because the neurologist said he should recover fully.        If they can walk, don't wait on an ambulance, throw them in a vehicle and get them to a major hospital ASAP.  It would probably have been at least an hour longer wait if we had waited on an ambulance.  Ideally, know what your local medical facilities are known for (heart, stroke/neurological, children, etc) and where they are so you can make an educated choice about which you should drive to.-----EDIT 1:  Woke up so grateful to see that many people are seeing this info.  My dad told me once he was able, ""you saved my ass"", so hopefully this info will allow you save someone else's ass.    EDIT 2:  Per u/SquiddlyGiggly, giving aspirin is a no-no because it can make the stroke worse.  Good to know, I'll pass that info along.  I think my mom gave him aspirin because my dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64 and she probably thought he might be having a heart attack and just couldn't speak due to being out of breath.  Which leads me to...    EDIT 3:  My dad had a quadruple bypass when he was 64.  He said his blood pressure has been fine even without medications, so he stopped taking his medications for his heart awhile ago.  And apparently he was right about not having heart blockages or high blood pressure, but those aren't the only heart worries it seems.  I thought he was still getting checkups, but I learned after this that he has been refusing to go see his doctor.  If he had, perhaps they would have caught the Atrial Fibrillation (A Fib) and treated it before this happened.  My mom thinks this was a blessing because hopefully it will be a wake up call for him to take ongoing checkups seriously.        So one more thing to add to this LifeProTip, show your family members this story and the importance of getting checked out and addressing issues before they become worse.  Dad said another stroke patient came in while he was there, and the guy was basically a vegetable.  Remind family that they may be ready to die, but are they ready to live with permanent handicaps like not being able to speak or use half their body.    EDIT 4:  I just remembered a stroke patient I had when I worked at the hospital.  Guy was late 40s, maybe early 50s, looked like he was in great shape (thin body type) and like he worked a manual job.  He was laying there with his eyes closed and not able to speak, just grunt.  I ""think"" that was his 2nd or 3rd stroke, progressively getting worse I think.  Anyway, my point is, do not judge their age or outer appearance as to whether they can have a stroke.    -----EDIT 5:  Credit to u/RetardedinRetrospect for linking this video that shows a Stroke as it happens:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kgmqPahsSE&feature=youtu.be    Also, an informative TEDtalk on the subject:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD7Y9CXeUw",1069,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kkyl76/lpt_know_the_signs_of_stroke_my_dad_had_stroke_on/,36817

klbhrj,cyberkrist,LPT: When dressing for cold weather prioritize circulation over insulation,Clothing,"As a wilderness guide one of the biggest mistakes I see people make when dressing for harsh winter conditions is bringing improperly fitted boots and gloves.  Hampering circulation to your extremities is surprisingly easy to do, and becomes more apparent in the cold.  Boots tied to tightly or tightly fitting gloves hamper your circulation and prevent your warmed blood from getting to your fingers and toes.  It doesn’t matter what a pair of gloves/boots are rated for if there is no heat from circulation to contain (clothes do not warm you, they trap your natural body heat).  Loosen your boots much more than you would in summer months and ensure your gloves don’t fit too tightly around the wrist.  If you find your feet cold loosen your boots.  If your fingers start going numb, remove your gloves, shake your hands, and pocket them for a few minutes (never blow on your hands).",1112,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/klbhrj/lpt_when_dressing_for_cold_weather_prioritize/,31978

kobiui,maybeest,"LPT: Beware the ""Intern Trap"". Don't take a job as a X Intern at a company that doesn't have anyone who can do X.",,"Interning should be a process of learning a craft while you help to contribute to the overall institutional goals. If a company is advertising for an intern position, but doesn't have anyone who does that job, then they are probably just trying to pay someone less for a job that they want someone to be able to do. Traditionally, these are jobs that young people are adept at, but older people may not have the skills to perform. For example, they probably need/want a Social Media Manager, not a Social Media Intern, but they want to pay less, hence the title. If you interview for a position like this, ask who at the company you will be learning from. If they don't have someone senior in the role, they may be willing to offer a mentor in other valuable skills - a senior marketing manager, for example. Consider negotiating a title that reflects what you will be learning, not just what you will be contributing. This will help you develop your resume and, well, hopefully learn new skills. Also consider negotiating a title change and salary adjustment to reflect that title. ""It seems that you don't have anyone at the company in a position to mentor a Social Media Intern and that what you really need is a Social Media Manager. I'm happy to take that role, at the junior level, and prove my worth to the company."" Really take a look at the learning on offer and what it's worth to you - if they're paying you $20k less a year, then your mentorship better be up to that value. You can save yourself a lot of wasted time and money by avoiding this ""Intern Trap"".EDIT: To be clear, some internships are genuine where you trade your work for real on the job learning (and a small paycheque). These should have someone on staff who is responsible to the intern - an actual mentor - or there should be a clear trade of skills/experience for your work and time. These are not the ""Intern Traps"" I intended to warn about. Nor am I talking about internships or practicums related to an educational course of study.I'm talking to job seekers looking for a job who might be undervaluing their skills, potentially negotiating with a company that is trying to take advantage of the applicant.  In Canada, where I'm from, unpaid internships are (now) illegal, though were prevalent early in my career. These privilege people who have enough resources and support to be able to give their time and labour away without financial compensation and disadvantage people who can't afford to work for free because they have bills to pay.EDIT 2: Thanks for the Helpful awards and the Silver! My first ever and I appreciate it!EDIT 3: A lot of people are reading this post as anti-internship. It is not intended to be! I am very pro-internship. This is a tip to ask in the interview to determine if what is on offer is, indeed, an internship or if it is a lowball play for your skills and labour. Just know what you are getting into by asking about the mentorship, training, and skills that they plan for you to learn. If they don't have a plan, they *might* be exploitative. If you had a great internship experience, great! Lucky you! And thanks for sharing these experiences. It's great to know some people have made the best of their situations, or, indeed had a good experience with a company that does internships right.",582,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kobiui/lpt_beware_the_intern_trap_dont_take_a_job_as_a_x/,33982

It’s okay, and don’t feel like you’re disappointing your “past self” for wanting something different.",Miscellaneous,"I came across this revelation not too long ago. I’ve posted/commented on other subs about this struggle before. I realized many others related. When I was younger I was very passionate about, well, everything. In middle school I was already starting full-fledged businesses, in highschool I was teaching myself robotics + programming. Always wanted to work at startups, always wanted to be a part of something. But the key thing is: I would frown upon those that had no passion in life. I’d use that quote over and over again about most men dying at 25 but being buried at 75. I could not wrap my head around someone wanting a peaceful life where they just want to settle down and enjoy themselves. I considered it an *early death*.Fast forward a few years, and that’s exactly what I wanted. My passion passed and I was prioritizing stability above all else. And I hated myself for it. I searched for ways to get back to my super motivated and passionate self. I didn’t want to become that adult I swore I would never become. Some people told me it may be a mental illness, and it can be in your own situation, but that never ended up being the issue. Others said to just get my shit together and get disciplined. Which I did do, but I really just improved my health/lifestyle. I never got back to that feeling where it felt like I wanted success more than anything. Where it felt like I was breathing fire.So, to sum it up, it took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that it’s okay to prioritize stability as you get older. It’s a part of growing up. Your priorities will change. I mean, if you’re able to pull constant overnighters and run your own business at 35? That’s great, good for you. But for most of us, that won’t last forever. And that’s okay. Or maybe it’s the opposite case for you, where you currently want to be a single CEO or something while your past self wanted a nice big family. That’s okay too. Your past self won’t be disappointed in you, because your past self is a construct you’ve made up in your mind. There’s most likely no way to fully recreate your past mindset. Right now, you are your present self. And all that matters is what your present self prioritizes and wants in their life.PS: This is my first time posting here so I’m not 100% sure if this belongs or if the flair is right.

My grandmother went and saw that our laundry baskets were full so she just grabbed that as she wanted to get us out of there ASAP. Her logic, all the dirty clothes are things we chose to wore, and cleaning them would take a few hours, but in this moment it takes a minute to just grab them. If we were to try and pack our clothes, it would just extend the amount of time we would be in that toxic situation of crying, yelling, and screaming. Luckily my brother was a stickler for laundry and had gotten each of us our own basket. Older siblings, and grandparents are the best.I've remembered that ever since, and every time I've needed to leave in an immediate hurry and didn't have time to pack for whatever reason but would have time to clean the clothes later, laundry basket. I've told this story for 18 years to people, and I can count on both hands off the top of my head the amount of times someone told me this actually came in handy. I've been told of abusive relationships, emergency evacuation situations, and several other random situations that required the gathering of clothes immediately.I happened to remember this due to having a dream about that incident, and don't recall anyone sharing this tip. It surprisingly saves a lot of time, hassle and effort if you don't mind working a little later.

Then remove the tape, and re-stick it on the wall where you want to hang it. Now you have a perfect fool proof spacing for your screws. This one was life changing for me. So simple yet so effective. Perfect alignment and super easy to level every time.This is especially helpful for keyhole hangers where the head of the screw has to line up perfectly with the fat part of the keyhole slot.

Thanks so much for all the awards! To those saying “I guess this is for people who don’t know how to use a measuring tape”... I was a professional carpenter/woodworker for several years of my life, I definitely know my way around a measuring tape. “Story sticks” are used in all aspects of woodworking... especially woodturning, this is basically a “story tape”. It’s used when the exact numerical measurement doesn’t matter, but the exact spacing or length does. This is basically that. Sure, you can try to take the measurement, eyeballing the centre of the hooks on the bracket and then transfer it to the wall... holding a tape measure sideways on a wall is not that easy to do either. Or you can do this. It’s just a life hack. You can do whatever you want.... this works and it’s pretty fool proof and it’s saved me a lot of headaches.

Pay attention to small things that frustrate them.....,Social,"Been with my wife for almost 23 years, and she has always gotten me great gifts, even early on when we didn’t have much money to spend on each other.  About 10 years in we got into a conversation about how I find it so difficult to come up with thoughtful gifts compared to how adept she seems to be.  When I asked her how she did it, she casually said,“I pay attention to what makes you curse!”And I’ll be damned if the vast majority of the gifts that I found most memorable and oft-used were the direct result of the thing that guys often catch a bad rap for trying to do for others.......solving problems.Did I trip over a power cable multiple times building out her chicken coop?  Cordless drill.Was I always complaining about how I can’t get my pillow to support my head throughout the night?  Contour pillow.Remarking how much I hated constantly cleaning out the gutters underneath a big oak tree?  Gutter covers.That’s it.  Simple stuff that often doesn’t break the bank.  That being said, of course there is room for gifts that don’t have to solve a problem and are a little more extravagant or frivolous and just make somebody happy, but I’ve put this technique into use in the years since and always come up with great gifts for the guys in my life.Understand that this LPT isn’t exclusively for men, of course.

No one should find out from Facebook that someone they were closed to died.",Social,"Please wait a day or two before posting to social media about a loved ones passing. People should get the news through the proper channels and not through a post that says “RIP Brotha”Unfortunately, that’s what happened to me. A close friend of mine unexpectedly died. I was traveling at the time and a friend posted to social media the second that he found out. I was scrolling through my phone sitting on a subway when I read the post. I should have been told through a phone call or at least something more personal. Facebook is the last place I want to find that information out - especially for a close friend.To be clear, I’m not arguing that you shouldn’t post condolences or fond memories at all. All I’m saying is wait at least a day so people close to the deceased can properly be notified.Don’t think you’re cool because you were the first to break the bad news to all of your Facebook friends. Be respectful of the people around you that could be about to go through a difficult time.&#x200B;**Edit:** Wow! I’ve never had a post blow up before. Now I understand what RIP my inbox means.I can’t believe how many people this has happened to. To all of you who found out that a loved one passed in this way, I’m truly sorry. It’s really impersonal and is a horrible start to the grieving process.I think a great addition from u/illthinkofonel8er is “Not just death, births, engagement, weddings, pregnancies, anything big”. A good rule of thumb is to let the main people involved give the news and share your thoughts after. Again, I would argue in the case of deaths, don’t share on social media for 24-48 hours even if you are one of the main people close to the deceased. Let it go through the correct, personal channels before posting.To the people that say it’s not a big deal, it’s a valid opinion. The main thing is that the person died and more people know about it now. However - maybe I’m old fashioned, but I would prefer a call or something more personal if it’s someone close. I’d like to talk it over with someone I care about and understand the full extent of the situation.To all of you who say “delete Facebook and never worry about it again”, you’re not wrong. For a lot of people, social media is very toxic. For some (me included), it’s still a way of getting small updates from friends that you are no longer close with. There are events and deaths that I probably wouldn’t have known about if it wasn’t for social media and I’m glad I found out though Facebook rather then not finding out at all. That being said, it wouldn’t have made a difference to me if I would have found out those things a couple days later.To all of you who say “just don’t post anything”, you’re also not wrong. People make these posts about themselves to just get attention. It’s really not a good look in my opinion. I will say that there is a time to make a thoughtful post or share some old pictures if you feel that’s necessary. There’s definitely something cathartic about people that you genuinely care about giving support and knowing that you’re not going through something alone. I personally enjoy seeing old stories and thoughtful post and pictures about friends who have passed.I just advocate for having good timing and good reasoning for these types of posts.",1177,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/mden1f/lpt_if_someone_passes_away_and_you_found_out/,31377

It’ll also help you be more proactive in reducing possible waste which will save you money.For perishables like milk, tofu, meat, cottage cheese or anything else you can eat, set a reminder a week or a few days before the expiration date. Then, it’ll be more likely that you can actually manage to use the perishable food or, possibly, it might at least give you time to offer someone else the food you know you just won’t use. This sounded really silly when I first came up with the idea, but it has been a lifesaver in terms or reducing food waste. It has felt even more important now that money has become more of an issue, and using the milk instead of dumping it down the drain feels much better inside.As a final note, there are many foods which last a couple days past the expiration date, but cottage cheese is NOT one of them. It’s not worth it. It will smell fine, but it will probably still give you food poisoning.",898,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/mlgf5r/lpt_there_is_no_shame_in_setting_calendar/,30551

A university lecturer here in the UK is simply someone who teaches at a university. I know in some other places we are called ""professors"", but that's kind of an inaccurate term, since we are rarely professors in terms of our qualifications. A professorship in terms of the qualification comes after a doctorate. I personally have a doctorate, and thus my title is ""doctor"", but that's entirely different to a MEDICAL doctor (M.D), which I am very much not. At any rate, you don't even need to be a doctor to teach at a university here in the UK, just someone experienced in the field you're teaching in (my doctorate isn't even remotely related to games development, which is what I teach, for example). I wonder whether people are thinking I'm claiming to be a medical doctor or something? My doctorate is in a subject related to medicine, but I am not qualified as a literal MEDICAL DOCTOR, as in someone who can treat you in a hospital and prescribe medication etc. Do I sound that intelligent to you?? Trust me, I'm not XDMaybe people are confused because a doctorate simply means you've completed a doctorate (often called an ""academic/research degree"") in the UK? Anyone can apply to do one, and universities frequently publish requests for people to apply to undertake them. In my case, I was required to take an MPhil (Master of Philosophy) course before I began the doctorate. That's pretty standard since I didn't have one yet, and someone else was funding my doctorate application.If you want more information, shoot me a message and I'll provide proof of this all.

They come with a memory card, which stores the video as your drive. When the card gets full, it should automatically delete the oldest video's to fit the new videos. If an accident occurs, your pull the memory card and plug into your computer to save the video you want. The dashcam plugs into your vehicles cigarette lighter. As far as I know, no dashcam records multiple viewpoints. You will need to purchase more than one dashcam if you want front, rear, and side facing dashcams. Hopefully this helps to address some of the questions I have seen.Update #2: someone says  dash cams that record multiple angles at once do exist. I didn’t know this, but great info!
